        Prince George's county Central Services expenditures are not clearly defined for county residents and thus residents are left in the dark about how their taxes are being used. Limited information makes it almost impossible for residents to discern whether the best solutions and decisions are being implemented in their communities.

        This interface is intended to allow access to insights regarding what the Central Services budget consists of; users can utilize a bar chart of search bar to visualize and analyze how tax money is spent.
